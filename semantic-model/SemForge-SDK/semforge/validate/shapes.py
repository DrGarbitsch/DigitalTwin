"""Which data view a shape is validated against, and whether it said so honestly.

A shape declares its view with semforge:dataView. The default is `current`,
which is right for every Core constraint and for the whole production KMS.

The declaration is then CHECKED against the shape's body, because getting it
wrong is silent: an aggregate evaluated over the collapsed view computes across
one instance where four were meant and returns a plausible number, never an
error. That is the failure class C1 exists to prevent, so a mismatch fails the
build naming the shape.

Detection follows the same rule the compiler uses -- lib/sparql_to_sql.py keys
off the presence of GROUP BY / aggregate functions in the query algebra.
