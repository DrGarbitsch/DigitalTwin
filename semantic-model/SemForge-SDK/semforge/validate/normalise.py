Ported from shacl2flink/tests/pyshacl-compare/compare.py. The NGSI-LD RDF
encoding puts every attribute in a blank node, so pyshacl reports focus nodes

of ngsild:hasValue. What a reader needs is the entity and the attribute.

This is also what keeps blank node LABELS out of every downstream identity --
they are not stable across runs, so a residue digest built on them would churn
