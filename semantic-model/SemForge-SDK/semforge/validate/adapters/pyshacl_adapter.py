"""The pyshacl adapter.

Two things here are not obvious and both were learned the expensive way in
shacl2flink/tests/pyshacl-compare/compare.py:

* The knowledge graph belongs in the DATA graph, not in ont_graph. Passed as
  ont_graph it is invisible to sh:class, so every sh:class over a value typed
  only by the knowledge -- `iff:state_OFF a iff:MachineState` -- reports a
  violation that is not one. The validator has to see the same world the
  constraints are written against.

* advanced=True. SHACL-AF is what sh:rule and sh:sparql need, and the kms
  shapes are mostly those.
