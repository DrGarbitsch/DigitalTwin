"""Renaming a shape, a test case, a suite -- and everything that names it.

A shape's IRI is written where it is declared, where other shapes reach it
(`sh:node` and the like), in a SPARQL body now and then, in every assert that
names one of its constraints (`ns:Shape/…Component`), and in the digest of
every residue it contributes to. A rename that misses one of those leaves a
package that reads as validated and is not: a stale assert, a residue that
no longer matches, a `sh:node` to nothing. So the rename is planned first,
said in full, and written only when the shapes graph after it is the graph
before it with one IRI replaced.

A case is named by its file, relative to the expectations.yaml that declares
it; a suite by its folder. Neither name enters a digest, so renaming one is
a move and an edit of the entries that point at it.
