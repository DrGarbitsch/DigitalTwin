"""Adding an attribute to a shape: the constraint, both layers, at once.

The one way an attribute reached a shape before was a side effect -- "go to
the rule" on an attribute with none wrote a bare `sh:path` stub, which the
capability check then reports as compiling to nothing. That is right for a
jump, which must not decide anything, and wrong for an author who has said
"this type has this attribute": they have decided, and the shape should say so.

What gets written is the NGSI-LD two-layer encoding the scaffold teaches:

    sh:property [ sh:path ex:hasState ;            the attribute is there,
        sh:minCount 1 ; sh:maxCount 1 ;            once,
        sh:nodeKind sh:BlankNode ;                 as an attribute node,
        sh:property [ sh:path ngsild:hasValue ;    and its value is there,
            sh:minCount 1 ; sh:maxCount 1 ;        once,
            sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;                   and is what was asked for
            sh:class ex:MachineState ] ]

The kind decides the inner path -- a Relationship's payload is `hasObject`, a
Property's `hasValue` -- and is read from the knowledge, never asked: that is
what the knowledge's `rdfs:range` is for. What the value must BE is asked,
because the knowledge deliberately does not say: `sh:class` is the shapes'
business (see choices.nesting).

The refusals are the point as much as the write:

  * an undeclared attribute -- declare it in the knowledge first, or nothing
    else (pickers, references, the Knowledge view) will ever know of it;
  * one the knowledge gives to another type -- the shape would demand it of
    entities that never carry it, and every one of them would fail;
  * a sub-attribute -- it hangs off an attribute node, not off the entity;
  * one already constrained here -- edit it instead;
  * one constrained by a supertype's shape -- SHACL conjoins, so a second
    declaration is an override, and that has its own command, which says
    whether the change tightens or can never take effect.
