"""Deleting an attribute, and everything that would dangle without it.

An attribute is not one thing in one file. It is a declaration in the
knowledge, property shapes that constrain it (possibly nested inside other
attributes, possibly in several shapes), keys in every document that carries
it, asserts in the expectation files that name its constraints, and -- the hard
one -- the SPARQL bodies that read it.

Deleting only the declaration is the failure this module exists to prevent: the
shapes keep a `sh:path` the ontology no longer knows, the data keeps a key no
constraint judges, and nothing anywhere says so. So removal is planned first,
shown in full, and then done all at once or not at all.

What is removed, and what is not:

  * the declaration, each `sh:property` group whose path is the attribute
    (with whatever is nested inside it), the key in every model and example
    document, and every expectation assert naming one of those constraints --
    all mechanical, all verified before anything is written;
  * a SPARQL constraint or rule that mentions it, and any other ontology
    statement that does, are NOT. A query is not a list of parts: deleting it
    takes unrelated logic with it, and leaving it behind makes a rule that
    silently matches nothing. These BLOCK the removal until edited by hand.
