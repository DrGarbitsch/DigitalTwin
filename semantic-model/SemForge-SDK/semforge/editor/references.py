"""Find-references: every place in a package that names a term.

The use that matters is the one no text search gets right. From the
owl:ObjectProperty in knowledge.ttl, the references are the `sh:path` that
constrains it, the SPARQL body that reads it, and every example that exercises
it -- and those three spell it three ways: `iffBaseEntities:hasStrength` under
the Turtle file's prefixes, the same inside a query that may declare its own,
and whatever key the example's `@context` expands to that IRI. So matching is
done on the expanded IRI, never on the text.

Nothing here is protocol-shaped; the LSP server translates the result.
