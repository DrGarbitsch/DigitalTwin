"""Running examples against expectations, and reporting coverage.

Two separate questions, deliberately not merged:

* Did each example behave as declared? -- assertions and residue.
* Is each constraint actually exercised anywhere? -- coverage (H6).

The second exists because the first cannot answer it. A SPARQL constraint whose
body can never match returns an empty result set, which is byte-for-byte what a
satisfied constraint returns, so per-example status classifies it CONFORMANT on
every example forever. Only a negative example that asserts the constraint FIRES
proves it is alive. A positive example proves nothing about liveness.

And even both sides can be defeated together: a negative example written to make
a shape fire will carry whatever type the shape's author assumed, so a shape
targeting the wrong class and an example typed to match it agree with each other
and both pass. Coverage narrows the gap; it does not close it. What it
guarantees is that a constraint is not validating NOTHING.
