"""Current and history views of an NGSI-LD graph (implementation-plan.md H2).

An NGSI-LD attribute is identified by (entity, name, datasetId). Four values of
one attribute differing only in observedAt are four UPDATES of one attribute --
the broker keeps the last. In RDF they are four concurrent values, so
`sh:maxCount 1` reports a violation that says nothing about the data: it would
fire on any entity ever updated twice.

So validation of entity state runs against the CURRENT view, which resolves each
(entity, predicate, datasetId) to its latest instance. Aggregation over an
attribute's observations needs the HISTORY view, which keeps them all.

Neither view is universally safe, which is why the choice is declared per shape
rather than defaulted globally: counts on history are wrong in one direction,
aggregates on current are wrong in the other. The platform draws the same line,
per variable rather than per shape -- attributes_view is a top-1 dedup, and
lib/bgp_translation_utils.replace_attributes_table_expression resolves the
AGGREGATED variables to the raw attributes table while everything else falls
back to the view.

collapse_updates() is ported from shacl2flink/tests/pyshacl-compare/compare.py,
guards intact. Both guards are load-bearing and are pinned by tests:

  * datasetId stays in the key. Two datasetIds are two attributes that happen
    to share a name, not one attribute updated twice, and collapsing across
    them would erase a value the broker keeps -- hiding any real count
    violation over them.
  * only instances carrying observedAt are collapsed. Repeated values without
    one are not a sequence of updates; collapsing them would suppress a
    GENUINE cardinality violation, which is the direction that matters.
