"""Sanity: references that point at nothing, and declarations nothing uses.

Every artifact of a package names terms the others are supposed to define, and
each of those links can break without anything failing. A `sh:path` to an
attribute the knowledge no longer declares still parses, still validates, and
still selects whatever data happens to carry the key -- it has simply stopped
meaning anything the package can explain. A SPARQL body that reads a removed
attribute matches nothing, which reads exactly like a rule that is satisfied.
An expectation that asserts a constraint which no longer exists fails, but it
says "did not fire", which sends the reader looking for a data problem.

So this is the cross-artifact check, one finding per broken link, placed on the
line that holds it:

  undeclared-path    sh:path names an attribute the knowledge does not declare
  undeclared-class   sh:class / sh:targetClass names an undeclared class
  sparql-undeclared  a SPARQL body names an undeclared term of the package's
                     own namespaces (a warning: a query is checked by token,
                     not by meaning)
  stale-assert       an expectation names a constraint no shape declares
  severity-unknown   an sh:severity that is no severity level: not SHACL's
                     violation/warning/info, nor an individual of sh:Severity
                     or a class derived from it
  severity-unlinked  a class whose individuals are used as severities but which
                     is not declared a kind of sh:Severity (information)
  unused-attribute   a declared attribute nothing uses (information)
  count-impossible   a property shape whose sh:minCount is above its
                     sh:maxCount: no data can ever satisfy it, so every
                     entity it judges fails -- for a reason no data can fix
  dataset-not-iri    a datasetId in the data that is not an IRI: the context
                     reads it as one, so a plain word silently becomes another
  dataset-none       an explicit "datasetId": "@none" -- the platform's name
                     for the default instance, which in the data is the one
                     WITHOUT a datasetId; written, it is a different instance
  dataset-unregistered  a datasetId in no namespace the package registers:
                     it has no attribute[prefix:name] to be read by
  unit-unknown       a unitCode in the data that is neither one of the curated
                     UN/CEFACT Rec 20 codes nor a unit of the package's own
  observed-at-invalid   an observedAt that is no timestamp: the platform reads
                     it as none -- the instance counts as now
  observed-at-format    an observedAt that is a timestamp but not in the kms
                     form (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ), in which text order is
                     time order
  observed-at-mixed     one datasetId with stamped and unstamped instances: the
                     unstamped one counts as now and supersedes every stamp
  observed-at-order     the observations of one datasetId out of time order in
                     the file: Scorpio and the bridge take the LAST one, the
                     attribute view the latest -- they would disagree
  dataset-duplicate  two instances of one attribute share a datasetId and an
                     observedAt (or both carry none): one update, written
                     twice -- the platform keeps only the last, so a count
                     over them tests what it never sees

Undeclared keys in the DATA are expect.vocabulary's, which predates this and
already places them; `check` reports both.

Each finding carries a `fix` -- what a quick fix needs to act on it -- so the
editor can offer "Declare it", "Remove this use" or "Delete attribute" without
recomputing anything.
